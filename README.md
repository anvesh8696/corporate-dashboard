# corporate-dashboard
An application using a front-end MVC framework of your choosing. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboardâ€™s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area. You should find, or create, your own data files in CSV and JSON formats to provide data to the dashboards.
